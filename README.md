This project utilizes sentence embedding models to measure text similarity using both cosine similarity and dot product similarity metrics. Each sentence is represented using an embedding model that allows the system to compute the similarity score between them. Cosine similarity calculates similarity based on the angle between the sentences in the embedding space, while dot product similarity measures the projection of one sentence onto another in the same space. The consistent results between these metrics demonstrate their effectiveness in highlighting textual similarities regardless of linguistic nuances, aiding in understanding and analyzing similarity between different sentences effectively.

The project utilizes the programming language Python as its primary language. It relies on several libraries to perform specific tasks:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

NumPy: For mathematical operations and scientific computations, such as computing similarity using dot product similarity.
sentence-transformers: To leverage advanced sentence embedding models like 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for generating sentence embeddings.
Other tools in Google Colab: Such as libraries for printing and displaying outputs like matplotlib, and tools for data handling such as pandas if used in the project.
These libraries facilitate tasks such as measuring text similarity between sentences and generating necessary embeddings efficiently and systematically within the Google Colab environment.
